> Configuration for my "Qtile-Oriented System", one of my default desktop config setups for linux.

## Required Prerequsites
To use this desktop setup for linux, a few prerequisites need to be met or are assumed to be present. 
Of course, it is assumed the user is using a display server or the like (e.g. X11, Wayland, etc).
Beyond that, this is primarily an openSUSE setup. I assume the default installer was followed,
and that a basic X (or I guess Wayland with some extra tweaks) session is available. Typically,
this is done with IceWM in some of the latest openSUSE2 tumbleweed versions.

**Text Editing Environment**

It is assumed the user has access to a text editor, such as Vim, Emacs, Nano, etc.
This setup assumes the user is using my configuration of Emacs, named
["Knavemacs"](https://github.com/knaveightt/knavemacs)

**Terminal Emulator**

It is assumed the user is using a terminal emulator, such as xterm that comes with X11.
This configuration has configs for two alternatives in the alternatives folder. However,
Im currently using wezterm as my daily driver.

## Installation
I put together a checklist.org file I use for a guided install of my programs and configuration.
Reference that and work through the notes to install the necessary packages and configurations.
