# Sample .bashrc for SUSE Linux
# Copyright (c) SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH

# There are 3 different types of shells in bash: the login shell, normal shell
# and interactive shell. Login shells read ~/.profile and interactive shells
# read ~/.bashrc; in our setup, /etc/profile sources ~/.bashrc - thus all
# settings made here will also take effect in a login shell.
#
# NOTE: It is recommended to make language settings in ~/.profile rather than
# here, since multilingual X sessions would not work properly if LANG is over-
# ridden in every subshell.

        return
    }

    # The behaviour is set to cd on quit (nnn checks if NNN_TMPFILE is set)
    # If NNN_TMPFILE is set to a custom path, it must be exported for nnn to
    # see. To cd on quit only on ^G, remove the "export" and make sure not to
    # use a custom path, i.e. set NNN_TMPFILE *exactly* as follows:
    #      NNN_TMPFILE="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/.lastd"
    export NNN_TMPFILE="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/.lastd"

    # Unmask ^Q (, ^V etc.) (if required, see `stty -a`) to Quit nnn
    # stty start undef
    # stty stop undef
    # stty lwrap undef
    # stty lnext undef

    # The command builtin allows one to alias nnn to n, if desired, without
    # making an infinitely recursive alias
